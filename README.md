# ACF 2.718 (WIP)

The Armoured Combat Framework was supposed to be a [Garry's Mod][] addon which creates a balanced, realistic and fun to play combat damage system, simulating projectiles, armor and explosions, as well as engines and gearboxes. However, it is still a bit buggy and is apparently a dead/dying project from what I've been told. In the interest of my server, I have decided to begin reworking this beloved addon to better function inside the mess that is the SOURCE ENGINE. If you have any feedback/criticism, I'd be more that happen to listen.

For right now, it's probably best if you don't download it while it's in heavy construction. However if you do, please let me know of any bugs that you find. Also, I will gladly hear any (reasonable) suggestions. Both can go in [ACF Issues][]

The [ACF Wiki][] has a lot of helpful ACF related information, but I plan on making my own wiki and tutorials at a later date.
